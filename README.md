2. **Assignments**: In this section, you'll find the assignments given during my database course. I have completed them to apply the theoretical knowledge and demonstrate my understanding of various database-related topics.

3. **Personal Projects**: The personal projects folder showcases the database projects I have undertaken independently. These projects allowed me to explore real-world scenarios and apply my knowledge in practical contexts. Each project comes with a detailed description, code, and any relevant documentation.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a learning resource for myself and others who are interested in databases. By documenting my progress, exercises, assignments, and personal projects, I aim to create a comprehensive collection of practical examples and insights into the world of databases.
